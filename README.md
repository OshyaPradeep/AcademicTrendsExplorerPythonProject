Academic Trends Explorer
Academic Trends Explorer is a data analysis project that focuses on student performance, degree distribution, and placement insights using Python and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:  
  Handles missing values, standardizes degree names, and converts fees from USD to INR.  
  Drops columns with excessive missing values (Backlog).  
  Fills missing numerical values (Marks) using the mean.  
  Sets ID as the index for structured data representation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
  Generates pie charts for degree distribution.  
  Plots histograms to analyze marks distribution.  
  Uses count plots to visualize student performance trends.

Exporting & Documentation:  
  Saves cleaned data into an Excel file (AcademicTrendsExplorer.xlsx).  
  Provides structured documentation of analytical insights.
